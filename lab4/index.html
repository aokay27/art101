			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab's challenge was to create some pseudocode based on an everyday task and a simple computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not really run into any serious problems during this lab, as the instructions were very clear and easy to follow along with. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment went fairly well and helped us learn the importance of pseudocoding and how it can make breaking a complicated task down into easier parts worthwhile. </p>
