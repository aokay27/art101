			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>My name is Byron James. I'm an AGPM major and some of my main interests are digital art, video games, character design, and thematic storytelling. Some of my favorite pieces of media are Night in the Woods and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. I'm hoping to work for an indie game company in the future, perhaps designing characters and writing story or dialogue!

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to edit the appearance of the text and borders of our website using HTML and CSS documents.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I was a bit confused about how to style the code properly, but with some collaboration and with some review of the previous lessons, we were able to get it working correctly.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment went very well and I learned how to make simple edits to the appearance and formatting of a website using HTML and CSS. I hope that I can now easily apply this knowledge on future assignments and even personal projects.</p>
