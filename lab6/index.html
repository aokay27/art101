			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to properly use JavaScript to create some simple arrays and objects, and then reference them properly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Learning the proper formatting and functions for the JavaScript language was difficult at first, but we managed to get the hang of it by looking at some examples. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment went well and that we were able to get a solid grasp of how to create arrays and objects in JavaScript, and get an idea of how they can be useful when programming more complex things. </p>
